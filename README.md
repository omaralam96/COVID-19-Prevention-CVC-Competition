## Description

Our Projectâ€™s idea is to mimic the fingerprint systems that is found in companies to record the arrival and leaving time of employees but instead of using fingers to avoid the spread of corona virus, we will use two cameras as follow:


*   First camera:

> Its task is to maintain appropriate **Social distance**.

*   Second camera

> 1.   Its first task is face mask detection which aim to detect faces and detect whether the mouth and nose of each entering employee are properly covered with face mask or not.

<p align="center"><img  src = images/face.jpg width="200" ></p>

>2.   Its second task is to detect if the employee is wearing gloves or not 

<p align="center"><img  src = images/gloves_and_mask.jpg width="200" ></p>

>3.  If the employee follows safety rules mentioned above, then the third task is OCR system which aim to detect ID of an employee entering the company. And record in sheet his/her arrival time

## Limitations

* With respect to camera 1
> Running video may be slow depending on the specs of the laptop because YOLOv3 needs high specs to be realtime, so it is recomended to run the application using your GPU instead.

*   With respect to camera 2
> Gloves have to be blue to be detected
